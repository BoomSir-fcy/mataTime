  "FAQ Q2": "Q2: How did the exchange rate of $DSG to $TIME be determined?",
  "FAQ A2": "A2: There are 10 rounds of $DSG exchange for $TIME. The price and value lock-up rules of each round are different. Generally speaking, the earlier the exchange, the lower the price, but the higher the lock-up ratio and the longer the lock-up period. Detailed rules are as follows:",

  "FAQ Q4": "Q4: What are the use cases of $TIME, and what can I do when I get $TIME?",
  "FAQ A4": "A4: $TIME is the requisite token for using the social product Metatime. Users need to pay 1$TIME per second when browsing content posted by others in Metatime (but as the total amount of $TIME gradually decreases, the consumption of $TIME per second may also be gradually reduced according to the results of governance), and users must use $TIME to complete tasks to get $MATTER.",
